<br>ABOUT
<br>The Mod activates many Story and Side Characters as Playable. No Model swapping. Only registry XRG editing. In addition, I made all standard characters of the light and dark sides playable for their respective counterparts. To expand all this work for them, I've created a new mission entry for the Light Side (l_m0) to give the player access to the map/level screen and allow playing the Introduction level with any character after the Intro. To enhance also the playability with weapons etc. I also created a "No Armor" slot to ensure 100% shield-free play. Since you can pick up a shield in some levels, you can now also drop it back at the same location. This wasn't possible without a direct imaginary weapon slot. The Mod has full localization support for all five StringTables: English (Default), German, Spanish, France and Italian. Optionally I created an Unlocker version of it, which removes all prices from weapons, shields, staffs, bows, crossbows, ammo and potions

<br>A big thank you to [Landon Rivers](https://github.com/landonrivers), who inspired me with his "[Modding Enclave - Play as Zale and Mordessa!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5MVluRYvf8)" video on
YouTube to create this mod idea, which also fits perfect into my INFINITY mod series.
