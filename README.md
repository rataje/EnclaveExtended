ABOUT
The Mod activates many Story and Side Characters as Playable. No Model swapping. Only registry XRG editing. In addition, I made all standard characters of the light and dark sides playable for their respective counterparts. To expand all this work for them, I've created a new mission entry for the Light Side (l_m0) to give the player access to the map/level screen and allow playing the Introduction level with any character after the Intro. To enhance also the playability with weapons etc. I also created a "No Armor" slot to ensure 100% shield-free play. Since you can pick up a shield in some levels, you can now also drop it back at the same location. This wasn't possible without a direct imaginary weapon slot. The Mod has full localization support for all five StringTables: English (Default), German, Spanish, France and Italian. Optionally I created an Unlocker version of it, which removes all prices from weapons, shields, staffs, bows, crossbows, ammo and potions

Marcus, Captain Lorus, Senator Alecto, Princess Jasindra, Queen Ayrindel, Assembly Guard, Ancestor Warrior, Zale, Mordessa, Scaara, Skeleton, Paladin

A big thank you to [Landon Rivers](https://github.com/landonrivers), who inspired me with his "[Modding Enclave - Play as Zale and Mordessa!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5MVluRYvf8)" video on
YouTube to create this mod idea, which also fits perfect into my INFINITY mod series.
